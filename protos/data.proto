/**
 * QuestNav Data Protocol Buffer Definitions
 * 
 * This file defines the data structures used for transmitting tracking and device
 * information from the Quest headset to external systems (such as robot code).
 * The data is organized into two main categories with different update frequencies:
 * 
 * 1. Frame Data: High-frequency tracking information (pose, timestamps)
 * 2. Device Data: Lower-frequency device status information (battery, tracking state)
 * 
 * This separation allows for efficient bandwidth usage by sending critical tracking
 * data frequently while sending less critical device status data at a lower rate.
 * 
 * Data Flow:
 * - Quest continuously processes camera/sensor data
 * - Frame data is sent every 10 milliseconds (100 Hz)
 * - Device data is sent every 333 milliseconds (3 Hz)
 * - External systems receive and process this data for robot localization

 * - Uses WPILib field-relative coordinate system
