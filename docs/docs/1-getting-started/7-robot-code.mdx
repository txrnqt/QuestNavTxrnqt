# Robot Code Setup

This guide explains how to integrate QuestNav into your robot code to provide accurate position tracking for your FRC robot.

## Verifying Setup
:::note
Before proceeding with integration, it is **highly** recommended that you verify that QuestNav is correctly
communicating with your robot
:::

### Checking NetworkTables Communication

Use AdvantageScope to verify that QuestNav data is being published to NetworkTables:

1. Launch AdvantageScope
2. Connect to NetworkTables using your robot's IP address
3. Look for the "QuestNav" table in the NetworkTables view

If values are updating, QuestNav is successfully communicating with your robot.

## Adding QuestNav to Your Project

:::note
The QuestNav project only **officially** supports Java as a language. However, as the system is built on top of
NetworkTables, any language that supports NT4 can be used!
:::
The QuestNav library is provided as a vendor dependency that you can add to your robot project. This approach makes it easy to integrate without complex dependencies.

### Installation Steps

1. Download the latest `questnavlib.json` asset from the [QuestNav GitHub releases page](https://github.com/QuestNav/QuestNav/releases)
2. Add this file to the `vendordeps` folder in your robot project (usually it will contain other JSON files as well)
3. Rebuild your robot code project

## Basic Usage

QuestNav communicates with your robot through NetworkTables. The class provides methods to access pose data from the Quest headset.
We recommend you call these methods from a subsystem if possible.

### Prerequisites
:::danger
v2025-1.0.0 **REQUIRES** the following methods from the `QuestNav` vendor dependency to be called periodically. Without this, the system
will not function correctly.
:::

Call this in *any* periodic method run by the CommandScheduler.
```java title="e.g. QuestNavSubsystem.java"
QuestNav questNav = new QuestNav();

@Override
public void periodic() {
   questNav.commandPeriodic();
}
```

### Getting Robot Pose
The `QuestNav` vendor dependency provides a method for getting the pose of the Quest itself. In order to estimate the position of the
robot, we need to transform the Quest's pose to the robot's center.

Here is an example of getting the latest pose from the Quest and transforming it to the robot pose. See the
[Setting Robot Pose](#updating-swerve-drive-pose) section below for a more complete example of using the pose from QuestNav for robot pose estimation.

```java title="e.g. QuestNavSubsystem.java"
QuestNav questNav = new QuestNav();

// First, Declare our geometrical transform from the robot center to the Quest
Transform2d ROBOT_TO_QUEST = new Transform2d( /*TODO: Put your x, y, rotational offsets here!*/ )

// Get the latest pose data frames from the Quest
PoseFrame[] poseFrames = questNav.getAllUnreadPoseFrames();

if (poseFrames.length > 0) {
    // Get the most recent Quest pose
    Pose2d questPose = poseFrames[poseFrames.length - 1].questPose();

    // Transform by the mount pose to get your robot pose
    Pose2d robotPose = questPose.transformBy(ROBOT_TO_QUEST.inverse());
}
```

:::tip
The FRC coordinate system follows these standards:
- X: Positive -> Forward from robot center
- Y: Positive -> Left from robot center
- Rotation: Positive -> Counter Clockwise

See the [WPILib Coordinate System documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/basic-programming/coordinate-system.html)
for details
:::

### Setting Robot Pose
:::note
An upcoming release of QuestNav will include AprilTag detection to periodically and automatically reset the pose to
a field relative position, potentially making this method unnecessary. However, it may still be used to provide
positional updates from other systems (auto start positions, PhotonVision, etc.)
:::
:::info
As of v2025-1.0.0, QuestNav uses [dead reckoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning) to estimate the headset's
position, so it's important to reset it at an accurate, known location on the field.
:::
Likewise, in order to set the pose of QuestNav, we need to transform that pose back from the robot centric pose to
the frame of the Quest.
```java title="e.g. QuestNavSubsystem.java"
QuestNav questNav = new QuestNav();

// First, Declare our geometrical transform from the robot center to the quest
Transform2d ROBOT_TO_QUEST = new Transform2d( /*TODO: Put your x, y, rotational offsets here!*/ )

// Assume this is the requested reset pose
Pose2d robotPose = new Pose2d( /* Some pose data */ );

// Transform by the offset to get the Quest pose
Pose2d questPose = robotPose.transformBy(ROBOT_TO_QUEST);

// Send the reset operation
questNav.setPose(questPose);
```
:::note
Notice how when transforming back to the Quest pose from the robot pose, we **don't** use the inverse translation.
:::

### Updating Swerve Drive Pose
The most common use case is to utilize the pose data from QuestNav with a SwerveDrivePoseEstimator for vision
correction. Most swerve libraries have a method to accomplish this.


:::danger
The last published value to NetworkTables will persist even if QuestNav disconnects. It is **imperative** you ensure
the Quest is connected and is tracking before using its pose data!

        :::tip
        This example works for ANY library that utilizes the `SwerveDrivePoseEstimator` class. The most common examples
        are YAGSL and the AdvantageKit template.
        :::
        ```java title="e.g. QuestNavSubsystem.java"
        QuestNav questNav = new QuestNav();
        SwerveDriveSubsystem swerveDriveSubsystem = new SwerveDriveSubsystem();
        Matrix<N3, N1> QUESTNAV_STD_DEVS =
            VecBuilder.fill(
                0.02, // Trust down to 2cm in X direction
                0.02, // Trust down to 2cm in Y direction
                0.035 // Trust down to 2 degrees rotational
            );
        
        @Override
        public void periodic() {
            if (questNav.isTracking()) {
                // Get the latest pose data frames from the Quest
                PoseFrame[] questFrames = questNav.getAllUnreadPoseFrames();

                // Loop over the pose data frames and send them to the pose estimator
                for (PoseFrame questFrame : questFrames) {
                    // Get the pose of the Quest
                    Pose2d questPose = questFrame.questPose();
                    // Get timestamp for when the data was sent
                    double timestamp = questFrame.dataTimestamp();

                    // Transform by the mount pose to get your robot pose
                    Pose2d robotPose = questPose.transformBy(QuestNavConstants.ROBOT_TO_QUEST.inverse());

                    // You can put some sort of filtering here if you would like!

                    // Add the measurement to our estimator
                    swerveDriveSubsystem.addVisionMeasurement(robotPose, timestamp, QUESTNAV_STD_DEVS);
                }
            }
        }
    ```

:::note
The above example should be called in a **periodic loop** to ensure vision measurements are always being added!
